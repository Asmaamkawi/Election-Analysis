Project Overview:
Analysis for an election of the Colorado board of elections for a local congressional election to determine the winning candidate and the largest voter turnout based on county. 
After analysing the data from the CSV file, I was able to find out that a total of 369,711 votes were casted in this election those are Denver, Jefferson, and Arapahoe. The breakdown of the total votes for each candidate was that Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote from the total votes, while Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote which are 11,606 votes and  inally Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote which is 272,892 votes, was the winner of this election.
